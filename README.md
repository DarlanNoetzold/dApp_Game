# dApp_Game

## Development:
* Javascript and Solidity were used;
* The Truffle framework was used to develop smart contracts;
* The local blockchain was configured and managed with Ganache;
* ERC 721 was also used, which is a standard for NFTs. Basically, it just describes all the functions that a token must implement;
* And the front end was made in React.

## Project:
* Proof of concept project for DApp development with token manipulation in a blockchain;
* The project is just a simple memory game, in which you receive Eth when you find a pair;
* A localhost network with the Metamask wallet was used for testing.

## How to use:
* First, you need to download the project and run the command:
```
npm install
npm run start
```
* Then, just configure the network in Metamask;
* And run the migrations to create the smart contracts.
